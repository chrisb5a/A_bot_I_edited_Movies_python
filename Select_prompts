After mistakenly open a spam email, Emily contracted a virus on her computer. The virus is an icon with an embedded program. The program takes 2ms to execute,
from that point on it creates an icon that it saves on the desktop every 1ms. At the same time, after 2ms, the program copies itself (slightly modified) and runs.
Assuming the virus is the icon autoreproducing itself every 1ms after 2ms, can you find a function in python to calculate the number of icons on the desktop after t ms?
